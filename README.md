# Square, building the front-end, square by square.

### Development installation.

Clone the repo from github, `make update && sudo make install` in the directory. This adds a `square` binary to your
`/usr/bin/` which is symlinked to the repository. So when you update this git repository the changes will be added to
square binary as well.
